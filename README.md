📖 How It Works

The user enters their playlist name and vibe. (Screenshot Part 1)

The script sends a request to OpenAI's DALL·E 3 to generate a corresponding image.

The generated image is downloaded, resized (256x256), and saved.

The image is converted to base64 format.

The script uploads the AI-generated cover to the user’s Spotify playlist using the Spotify API. (Screenshot Part 2)

The user can choose to generate another cover or exit.
