📖 How It Works

1)The user enters their playlist name and vibe.
2)The script sends a request to OpenAI's DALL·E 3 to generate a corresponding image.
3)The generated image is downloaded, resized (256x256), and saved.
4)The image is converted to base64 format.
5)The script uploads the AI-generated cover to the user’s Spotify playlist using the Spotify API
6)The user can choose to generate another cover or exit.
